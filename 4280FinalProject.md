## About the Feather River

The Feather River is the principal tributary of the Sacramento River, which discharges into the Suisun Bay, a tidal estuary of the San Francisco Bay Area. The measurements in the time series, according to the Time Series Data Library, were conducted between 10/1902 and 09/1977, but the data actually only appears to be complete through 09/1961, the same year which construction on the Oroville Dam began in earnest; the partially-completed Oroville Dam mitigated the local impact of the Pacific Northwest-wide Christmas floods of 1964, which caused a peak flow of 7100 <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m^{3}}{s}\)</span>. The Oroville Dam is the tallest dam in the US, at 235 m in height, and uses 480 <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m^{3}}{s}\)</span> of its flow limit of 4200 <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m^{3}}{s}\)</span> to generate power.
