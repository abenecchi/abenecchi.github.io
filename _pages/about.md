Who am I?
======

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Georgia studying Statistics and Finance, though I lean more towards the former. For as long as I can remember, I've loved mathematics and have always found interest in 

I got my start in statistics when I took AP Statistics in sophomore year of high school, and my teacher, Mr. Crowers, integrated current events (i.e. sports and political primaries) into classroom discussion, and showcased the interactive data visualizations found on [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com). I loved playing around with the simulations to view how they would be impacted by imagined scenarios, and having completed AP Statistics left me wanting to learn more.
